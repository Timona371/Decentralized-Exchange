- [x] `getPool(poolId, contractAddress, provider)` - Reads pool data using `getPool(bytes32)` function
- [x] `createPool(tokenA, tokenB, amountA, amountB, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `createPool` function
- [x] `addLiquidity(poolId, amount0, amount1, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `addLiquidity` function
- [x] `removeLiquidity(poolId, liquidity, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `removeLiquidity` function
- [x] `swap(poolId, tokenIn, amountIn, minAmountOut, recipient, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls AMM's `swap` function
- [x] `getUserLiquidity(poolId, userAddress, contractAddress, provider)` - Calls AMM's `getLpBalance` function
- [x] All functions return expected types matching the contract interface
- [x] Functions handle errors appropriately
- [x] Contract address configuration via environment variable

**Implementation Notes:**
- AMM contract bindings implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- All required functions implemented in `src/lib/amm.ts`
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable
- Commit: `f25afc3` - "feat: implement AMM contract bindings with TypeScript interfaces"

- Max button functionality for both add and remove liquidity
- Token balances and LP balance refresh after transactions
- Ratio warning displayed when input ratio doesn't match pool ratio
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Commit: `3801471` - "feat(liquidity): add token balance and allowance fetching for add/remove liquidity"

**Technical Notes:**

### Issue #10: Create Pool Component — Contract Integration
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `feature`, `pools`  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Depends on:** #6

**Description:**
Allow users to create new pools (token pair + initial liquidity) with deterministic ordering of token addresses. The UI exists but form submission not connected to contract.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Create pool page exists at `/pools/new`
- ✅ Form has token addresses, amounts, fee tier inputs
- ✅ Submit handler connected to contract
- ✅ Token approvals handled automatically
- ✅ Decimals fetched dynamically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] User enters two token addresses
- [x] Component automatically sorts tokens (token0 < token1)
- [x] User enters initial liquidity amounts
- [x] User selects fee tier (uses contract's defaultFeeBps)
- [x] Component validates inputs
- [x] User can submit create pool transaction
- [x] Transaction sent to AMM contract's `createPool` function
- [x] Pool ID calculated and displayed
- [x] Success redirects to pool details page
- [x] New pool appears in pools list

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implemented robust token sorting and decimals handling
- Added automatic approval flow for non-ETH tokens
- Enhanced `createPool` library function to support native ETH and custom fees
- Commits: `a724aa5`, `80fd606`, `57d4120`

**Technical Notes:**
- Token addresses must be sorted: `token0 = min(tokenA, tokenB)`, `token1 = max(tokenA, tokenB)`
- Pool ID: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1, feeBps))`
- Contract uses `defaultFeeBps` from constructor (not user-selectable in current contract)
- Need to approve both tokens before creating pool
- Initial liquidity sets the starting price
- **Contract Address:** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable. Contract will be deployed and address provided.

## Token Streaming Issues

### Issue #12: Port Token Streaming Contract Library (`lib/streaming.ts`)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Labels:** `frontend`, `token-streaming`, `critical`, `blocking`  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
Implement ethers contract wrappers to call Token Streaming contract functions and read events. Create `lib/streaming.ts` with functions to interact with the streaming protocol.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `getAllStreams(contractAddress, provider)` - Reads StreamCreated events from contract
- [x] `getStream(streamId, contractAddress, provider)` - Reads stream data using `getStream(uint256)` function
- [x] `createStream(recipient, token, initialBalance, timeframe, paymentPerBlock, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls contract's `createStream` function
- [x] `refuel(streamId, amount, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls contract's `refuel` function
- [x] `withdraw(streamId, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls contract's `withdraw` function (recipient)
- [x] `refund(streamId, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls contract's `refund` function (sender)
- [x] `updateStreamDetails(streamId, paymentPerBlock, timeframe, signature, signerAddress, contractAddress, signer)` - Calls contract's `updateStreamDetails` function
- [x] `getWithdrawableBalance(streamId, account, contractAddress, provider)` - Calls contract's `getWithdrawableBalance` function
- [x] `hashStream(streamId, newPaymentPerBlock, newTimeframe, contractAddress, provider)` - Calls contract's `hashStream` function for signature generation
- [x] All functions return expected types matching the contract interface
- [x] Functions handle errors appropriately
- [x] STREAMING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS constant exported

**Technical Notes:**
- Token Streaming contract uses `uint256 streamId`
- StreamCreated event signature: `StreamCreated(uint256 indexed streamId, address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, ...)`
- Need to use ABI from `src/lib/abi/TokenStreaming.json`
- Signature verification needed for `updateStreamDetails`
- **Contract Address:** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAMING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable. Contract will be deployed and address provided.

**Blocking:**
This issue blocks all token streaming frontend features.
